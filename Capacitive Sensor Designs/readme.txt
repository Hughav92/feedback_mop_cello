There are two designs for the capacitive sensors included. Which to use is personal preference.
Design 1 offers a little more playablity, although takes a lot longer to assemble than design 2.
Further work on a new design is required as future work.

Both designs come as an A4 pdf. Each has multiple copies of the design. A single template is one column.
When referring to a template in the assembly guide, just a single column is what is meant.

This can just be printed and should be the correct size.

For design 1, the red boxes are not included in the design. These are just meant to aid in assembly,
and these connections between the sensors should not be included in the aluminium foil sensors.

For the final prototype I used design 2, as this was quicker and easier to assemble.

An earlier prototype used design 1.
